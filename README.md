This project is a **Rock-Paper-Scissors** console game developed in C#. It allows a player to compete against a computer opponent in a classic game of Rock-Paper-Scissors. The program uses a random number generator to determine the computer's choice and compares it with the player's input to decide the winner of each round. The game continues until either the player or the computer wins 3 rounds. Scores are tracked and displayed after each round.
